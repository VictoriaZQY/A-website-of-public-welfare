This website is used to help underprivileged women gain knowledge through discussing in the forum and reading official articles, and to provide employment opportunities. 

This project is part of Group 4's COMP3030J Software Engineering Project 2 assignment, which involves 5 members. To complete this project, in the front-end, we employed React for Web framework, CSS and HTML for style, TypeScript for script, Jtest for testing; in the back-end, we made use of Flask for framework, MySQL for database, Cloudinary for object storage, Redis for cache, OpenAI for AI integration and Pytest for testing.
